MNIST Hand-written Digit Recognition using Keras
==================================================

Architecture:

2-layer neural network
input layer has 784 neurons
hidden layer has 1000 hidden neurons with ReLU activation function and He et. al. based weights initialization
output layer has 10 neurons with softmax activation function and Xavier initialization
loss function used is cross-entropy loss

learning rate = 0.09
regularization rate = 0.001, L2-regularization

performed 10-fold cross validation and in every fold, performed mini-batch gradient descent with 30 as the size of mini-batch
